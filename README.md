# Data Analytics of Jobs.

In this repositry, we analyse the the data from (this kaggle website) and look at how people's level of education, gender and years of experience affect their salary.

## Cleaning of Data
We cleaned the data by firstly removing NaN values. Then we merged the education level that meant the same things but are written differently. We then made dummy variables for each education level and genders.

## T-testing and Confidence interval

We conducted T-testing and measured the confidence interval to obtain the results that the salaries between males and females are statistically significant. For this dataset, we can conclude with 95% confidence interval that males earn more than females.

## Machine Learning
We made use of Linear regression and Lasso regression to predict the salaries given a person's gender, education level and years of experience.
